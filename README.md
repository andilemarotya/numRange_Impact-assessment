# Impact's Takehome Assessment
# 1.Project's Title: Number Range Summarizer


2.Project's Description: Implementing a java interface to produce a comma delimited list of numbers,
   grouping the numbers into a range when they are sequential. 
   (e.g.) "1,2,3,4,6,8" => "1-4,6,8".
   
   
   
3.How to Install and Run the Project:
  (i) Install IntelliJ IDE , Java JDK version 17
  
  (ii) Download this project as zip or clone this repository
  
  (iii) Go to Test.java and run the project, this is where the main method is located
  
  

4. All the instructions of the project are in "NumberRangeSummarizer.java" file, DO NOT MODIFY. 
   cdListNumbers class in "cdListNumbers" is the implementation of the NumberRangeSummarizer interface.
   cdListNumbers contains two methods, to collect the comma delimited string and convert it to a Collection/List.
   and the second method contains algorithm of grouping the sequential numbers into range(s)
   
   Test.java is where we test our Number range summarizer methods , both the from collecting the input string to collecting the Collection and returning the
   summarized string.
